abstract = "It has long been recognised that standard process algebra has difficulty dealing with actions of different priority, such as for instance an interrupt action of high priority. Various solutions have been proposed. We introduce a new approach, involving the addition of “priority guards” to Milner’s process calculus CCS. In our approach, priority is unstratified, meaning that actions are not assigned fixed levels, so that the same action can have different priority depending where it appears in a program. Unlike in other unstratified accounts of priority in CCS (such as that of Camilleri and Winskel), we treat inputs and outputs symmetrically. We introduce the new calculus, give examples, develop its theory (including bisimulation and equational laws), and compare it with existing approaches. We use leader election problems to show that priority adds expressiveness to both CCS and the π-calculus."

abstract="In this paper we address the problem of the expressive po- wer of point-to-point communication to implement broadcast communication. We demonstrate that point-to-point communication as in CCS [M89] is ``too asynchronous'' to implement broadcast communication as in CBS [P95]. Milner's $\pi$-calculus [M91] is a calculus in which all communications are point-to-point. We introduce b$\pi$-calculus, using broadcast instead of rendez-vous primitive communication, as a variant of value-passing CBS in which communications are made on channels as in Hoare's CSP [H85] --- and channels can be transmitted too as in $\pi$-calculus --- but by a broadcast protocol: processes speak one at a time and are heard instantaneously by all others. In this paper, using the fact that $\pi$-calculus enjoys a certain interleaving property, whereas b$\pi$-calculus does not, we prove that there does not exist any uniform, parallel-preserving translation from b$\pi$-calculus into $\pi$-calculus, up to any ``reasonable'' equivalence. Using arguments similar to [P97], we also prove a separation result between CBS and CCS.",

abstract="Local area networks (LANs) and everyday speech inspire a model of communication by unbuffered broadcast. Computation proceeds by a sequence of messages, each transmitted by one agent and received by zero or more others. Transmission is autonomous, but reception is not. Each message is received instantaneously by all agents except the transmitter, but is read only by those who were monitoring it at the time; others discard it. As in CCS, agents learn about the environment only through the messages they read. Programming such a system is hard because we have to ensure that messages are read.",
