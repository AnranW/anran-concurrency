# anran-concurrency
A repository for my experience at data61 (internship and thesis).

In this repository, you can find the results for my internship (topic: _Expressiveness for Distributed Systems_) and my thesis (topic: _Expressiveness of Process Algebras_).

In ./project expresiveness of distribited systems.pdf , you can find a project description, in which section "Encoding one formalism into another" is relevant.

In ./internship, you can find the source latex code as well as a pdf file (report.pdf) for the internship report, as well as experience report for DAAD's RISE project[^1], who generously provided scholarship for this internship.

In ./thesis, you can find the source latex code and a pdf file (main.pdf). Note that it is in eptcs style, which I prefer to the submitted version.
